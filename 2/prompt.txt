You are an experienced QA engineer.
Convert the following informal bug report into a well-structured, professional bug ticket using this exact format:

```
Title: A concise summary of the issue (1 sentence max)

Description: A brief explanation of the issue and any relevant context (2–3 sentences)

Steps to Reproduce: A numbered list of steps needed to trigger the bug

Expected vs Actual Behavior: Clearly state what should happen vs. what actually happens

Environment (if known): Include relevant details such as browser, OS, device, app version, and/or deployment tier (e.g., staging, production)

Severity or Impact: Assess how severely this affects users (e.g., “High – prevents user logout” or “Low – minor UI glitch”)
```

Be concise and professional. If any information is missing, infer it only if reasonable, otherwise leave it blank or note “unknown.”

Input bug report:

```
Logout button doesn't work on Safari. It just doesn't respond.
```
