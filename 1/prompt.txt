You are a software architect tasked with choosing the most appropriate database for a new application. Your goal is to analyze the requirements and determine the best type of database system. Use a step-by-step reasoning process (chain-of-thought).

Application description and requirements:

1. The app is a social platform expected to serve millions of users.
2. It must store user profiles, posts, and user-to-user connections (e.g., friends/followers).
3. High data read speed is a critical requirement.
4. The workload is expected to be 80% reads and 20% writes.
5. The system must be able to scale efficiently as the user base grows over time.

Instructions:
- Think step-by-step and explain your reasoning clearly. Build upon previous steps as you progress.
- Consider trade-offs such as consistency, latency, flexibility, and ease of scaling.
- Compare possible types of databases (e.g., relational, document-based, wide-column, graph, etc.).
- Try considering experience of existing projects that have similar requirements.
- Recommend the best database technology, and justify your final choice.
- Optionally, provide a few database technologies that also fit the requirements but are not at the first place.

Structure your answer as a chain-of-thought followed by a clear final recommendation.
